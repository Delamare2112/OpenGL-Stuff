# OpenGL Stuff
## I am learning OpenGL!
What fun I shall have I'm sure

Currently I am playing around with making a framework around OpenGL just to have fun and learn and stuff.

## Build
Use CMake.  So like for example:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target all -- -j8
```
For now the binary expects to be ran from the root directory.
```bash
cd ..
./build/HelloWindow
```

## Depends
* CMake
* OpenGL libs
* A compiler
* other things for sure. idk this Readme is really just a placeholder more than anything.

Remember to have fun and a great day!
