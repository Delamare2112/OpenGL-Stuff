# OpenGL Stuff
## I am learning OpenGL!
What fun I shall have I'm sure

Currently I am playing around with making a framework around OpenGL just to have fun and learn and stuff.

## Build
`make`

## Depends
* make
* OpenGL libs
* a compiler (makefile assumes clang for now)
* other things for sure. idk this Readme is really just a placeholder more than anything.

Remember to have fun and a great day!
